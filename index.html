		“The use of traveling is to regulate imagination with reality, and instead of thinking of how things may be, see them as they are.” – Samuel Johnson
		</p>
		<p>
		Often regarded as the "World Traveler", by colleagues, I enjoy the splendor of traveling. Whether it be within the country or to vast foreign countries. The world offers new, yet humbling experiences. I could say that in my lifetime, I have been to Tokyo, Japan - one of my favorites. The city is a bustling metropolis with superb organization. Sushi is like no other there, arguably the best!</p>

		"Over the years, Forgotten Realms and gaming have taken me all over the world and made me all sorts of new friends." - Ed Greenwood
		</p>
		<p>
		Mobile gaming has literally kept me "mobile" The underrated augmented reality game Ingress (predecessor of Pokemon Go) has motivated me to visit and learn about landmarks during my travels. The thought of collecting achievements is not your typical souvenir. </p>
